Create an interesting piece of ASCIIArt that represents something nicely on the output screen such as block letters, emoticons, clipart, memes, business or sports logos, etc. 

The width of the output should not be too wide or it will awkwardly wrap around the relatively short console window.

The file name may need to be changed from Main.java to HelloWorld.java or vice versa.
